IDX Quote Automation
====================

This project now includes a Python automation script that downloads IDX ticker
quotes from the public Yahoo Finance API and saves the snapshots into a Google
Sheets worksheet every hour.

How it works
------------
* Tickers covered by default: CMRY, MAIN, BBCA, BMRI, ARCI (queried via the
  `.JK` Yahoo suffix).
* Quote data is appended to the configured Google Sheets worksheet. Each row
  keeps the fetched price information, OHLC fields (open, day high, day low,
  previous close), along with a `latest_update_label` column similar to
  `"Latest update 14:00"`.
* Fetches run every hour by default, but you can override the interval with a
  command-line flag.

Running the automation
----------------------

```bash
python automation/fetch_idx_quotes.py
```

Useful flags:

* `--once`: Fetch once and exit. Useful for testing.
* `--interval <seconds>`: Change the fetch frequency.
* `--tickers <symbols>`: Override the tickers to fetch.
* `--spreadsheet-id <id>`: Target Google Spreadsheet ID (required).
* `--worksheet <title>`: Worksheet to update or create.
* `--service-account <path>`: Path to a Google service account JSON key.

The script creates the worksheet automatically the first time it runs (if it
does not already exist) and keeps the header row in sync with the stored data.
